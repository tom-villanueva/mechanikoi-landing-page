Iris Dissolution is a classic survival horror game where you explore increasingly surreal places, manage scarce resources, and fight for your life against horrid creatures as you struggle to come to terms with loss. 

Featuring fixed camera angles, strategic inventory management, intricate puzzles and a retro visual style; the game delivers a nostalgic experience alongside a touching story of helpless grief.
