### About the story

Having gone through some hard times recently, you find solace in tending to your garden.
While searching for new books on botanics, you stumble upon one that you haven't seen before. It is somehow enthralling, almost as if it's calling you. As you begin reading, it quickly becomes clear that it speaks of alternative ways of taking care of plants. It fills you with a feeling of unease, but maybe it'll grow into a new friend.
